## Point Cloud Local Ancestry Inference (PCLAI)

Point cloud local ancestry inference (PCLAI) is a deep learning-based approach for inferring continuous population genetic structure along the genome. Instead of assigning each genomic window to a discrete ancestry label, PCLAI predicts a **continuous coordinate** (e.g., a point in PC1–PC2 space) for every window, together with a **per-window confidence score**. For more technical details, we recommend reading [our corresponding preprint](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/pclai).
